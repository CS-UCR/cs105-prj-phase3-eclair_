This is the second phase of our FInal Project 
In this project, we use Python pandas, seabpmt and other libraries to cleand the datasets, and extract valuable information from it. The code is ran using a Jupyter notebook or Google Colab or any other similar notebook interpreter. We export our crawled findings to a csv file, and we are using other datasets from the CDC in conjunction with our crawled data to build a tool that demostrates which states use which drugs the most and how much of these drugs are reimnursed by Medicaid. So far, we plan to utilize this dataset https://data.medicaid.gov/State-Drug-Utilization/State-Drug-Utilization-Data-2018/e5ds-i36p. We will research more datasets as we delve deeper into the project.

The program will crawl webmd.com and generate a .csv file that looks like the following
